<p>This page was created when knowledge was low, everything on here is

<li>Old XBOX games<ul>
<li>Known bugs on the old games</li>
<li>Maybe it works (small probability that it has not been fixed)</li>
<li>Its been noted that few of the XBOX1 games whose GameSavs were
    exploitable appear on the X360 backwards list. However it's also
    worth knowing that games in addition to 007AUF, MA, and SC1
    contain similar flaws - but their exploitation was not felt
    necessary.</li>
<li>This probably does not work, since the XBOX360 emulates the old
    XBOX (with an emulator that is customized for each game). Using
    a bug in an old game would just "break out" into the emulated
    old XBOX. Of course, if the emulator design is sufficiently
    sloppy, it might be possible to have a second step that then
    compromises the actual XBOX360 security.</li>

<li>(early versions?) king kong will need a patch in order to be

<li>Manipulated media files<ul>
<li>Images, Music Files, Video<ul>
<li>Windows Media Center, after authenticating with the server,
    uses a client compiled for the 360 to access all Media
    Center functionality. the software is very buggy. would be a
    prime target for attack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start by trying out some exploits that are already known and see
    how the XBox360 reacts to them<ul>
<li>There is potential to use a .tiff overflow(?) Certainly if
    the Hypervisor behaves as suggested, it will catch the
    buffer overflow, but it might provide insight as to how it
    works.<ul>
<li>I emailed the team that did the .tiff overflow with the
    PSP (for anyone who knows about their work), and asked
    for info regarding how they went about .tiff exploit.
    They had some interesting things to say (I can email
    anyone their response if they want), and recommended
    <a href="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/classes/sp05/cse127/Smash.htm">this</a>.
    I'm sure its old business for alot of people, but its
    oer my head; I'm not able enough to get alot of it. If
    someone wants to work in conjunction with me to try this
    exploit out, my email is GBW88@comcast.net.</li>

    suggests various CPU parameters including Hypervisor mode and boot

    accessible and modifiable then security features could be disabled

<li>Theories are floating around some forums as to the validity of
    hacking DVD drive firmware to authenticate all discs as OK. Firmware
    has some basic bitswapping and xor-ing which was defeated quickly,
    maybe potential to change it?<ul>

    xboxhacker.net. Unfortunately, it starts in the name of backups,
    but it contains large amounts of insight as to how the DVD
    system functions. Signing code would still be a problem, but
    bypassing mediachecks could help at least.<ul>
<li>(Offtopic) If it is possible to modify the firmware, would
    it then not also be possible to read the 'hidden' security
    areas on (for example) audio-dvd?</li>

<li>Buses<ul>
<li>If some bus are accessible but at too much high speed(don't
    remember well the design of the 360 i must re-read the
    documentation and websites) maybe use of highspeed DAC or
    professionals osciloscope for electronic design or
    aviation(maybe some people have access to such devices) or
    home-made ones (using some dac of some
    cards(video-cards,tv-cards))</li>
<li>Easiest way to do DAQ is to use an NI DAQ system of allmost any
    kind (w/ fast enough DAC, something like FLASH-DAC)
    <a href="http://www.ni.com/dataacquisition/">[3</a>]</li>
<li>Develop program for a snatching data from the bus. with high

<h3 id="ideas_1">IDEAS</h3>
<p>Xbox 360's OS has its root in the OS of the original Xbox (which is
derivate from Windows 2000). I think that some bug and exploit in Xbox 1
(or even 2000) still work on the 360, we have to try every
bug/fuzzing/hole knowed to find exploits.</p>
<p>Ideas :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>file format fuzzing (there are some tools in sourceforge), exampleÂ :
  image format like wmf (recent exploit in Win 2000 and XP plateform due
  to implementation of the fct escape() and not a BO!!!!!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XMA is a very good way to find some holes, and Sounds aren't signed
  (Demo DVD) Someone has Doc about XMAÂ ? maybe in XACTÂ ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by network UPnP (use XML), it's seems that the norm think about
  security like not permit to send XML break char, or limit ACL hack, but
  if there are an XML implementation (lib XML) there are chance to find an
  exploit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We all know Microsoft's security in their implementation of norms (like
  IP stack or other).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>by DMA, using USB (security hole in Win 2000\&amp;XP ohcpi) other way :
  IDE (sata), we can try to access to DMA with a PC connected to the
  Xbox...by SATA ;-) the idea is to use the PC like an IDE device for the
  Xbox 360. i'm reading the DMA-API and IDE doc for linux (if you have
  linux, interessting stuffs are in /include/Documentation/DMA-API.txt &amp;
  DMA-mapping.txt and in /include/Drivers/ide/ )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by threads, if we can use the GPU to access to RAM and acces to the
  same area as the CPU we can do some buggy things (in fact thread is not
  necessary)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>resources :</p>

<h3 id="xex-executables">XEX executables</h3>
<p>What security problems are known about the XEX files. They can be burned
to DVD/CD and used to install the backwards compatability emulator, so
attacking them would be a good idea. Since the OS for the 360 is based
on Windows, is the .xex file in any way related to .exe? .xex files
renamed to end in .exe do not do anything in Windows. I would like
further documentation on what happens when the emulation software is
executed via CD/DVD. --Monsuco 19:29, 9 Mar 2006 (CET)</p>
<p>The XBOX360 CPU is based on the PowerPC architecture, not on Intel like
PC CPUs. For that simple reason, an XBOX360 executable will never run
under a PC version of Windows.--Silence 10:59, 10 Mar 2006 (CET)</p>
<p>First guy is absolutly retarded >_> -Thilo</p>
<h3 id="xna">XNA</h3>
<ul>
<li>The XNA libraries are .Net wrappers around various DirectX libraries
  (XACT, XInput, Direct3D, etc), and runs on the .NET Compact Framework.
  Both frameworks are fairly large and complex and it could be a possible
  candy store for exploits.</li>
